Problem Statement - Create a word2vec/CBOW model, train the model on the given dataset and create your own embeddingdictionary with key as the token and embedding as the value.

a. Visualize the embeddings.

b. Show that similar words are close to each other in the visual cluster.

c. Also create a word similarity program that uses your generated embedding dictionary and based on the input words from the user, the word similarity is calculated.
